"This Nintendo Switch really makes me so happy and keeps me occupied during the quiet moments at work (remote working of course). The eshop is always full of offers and games on sale, really great games too! The variety of choices you get is enough to really make anyone happy. The only thing I wish I had done differently is getting the joycons in grey, just so they would fit any case a bit better.",sasybi,Best purchase I've ever made! makes me so happy,September 2022,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my soon to be 3 year old little girl, not knowing much about the product I also ordered a protective bumper pack ( screen protectors, case, silicone for device, headphones, stylus pen etc ) I ordered it and both parcels came the next day, I put her to bed that night and opened up the parcels so I could set it up so it was ready for her on Christmas Day, nothing worse than a excited child wanting to play and having to do updates and make accounts then download games etc I opened the actual Nintendo switch box and I was AMAZED!! At what was actually in there, there‚Äôs the device, the little coloured controllers that go on the side of it, a docking/charging station, all the leads, and a hand held controller pad that you put the controllers off the side of the device into to make it a hand held gaming controller and you play it separately from the device, as a first time buyer I was shocked but really really and I mean REAAAALLY happy that all these little bits and bobs where in there to, I thought I would have had to spend even more money on extras like the docking station and hand held controller etc, seriously worth every single penny I paid for it and one very happy customer, glad I just went for it and I can‚Äôt wait to see my baby girls face on Christmas morning üòäü•∞ wow!!!

"I love the switch! Came very well presented, and it‚Äôs very easy to set up.

"We bought this as a second Switch to use occasionally when playing together as a family, so a good used item suited our needs. The used condition was very good, although not quite as good as the seller described but close enough to warrant keeping.Actually using the Switch is as good as a new one and I have no complaints at all here.

"My thoughts:This a good console if you want a console for your TV whilst having a on the go console. Very easy to set up and very easy & convenient to switch from TV to handheld. It comes with all the cables and accessories you need to start playing right away.Who this is for:-People who can only afford one console whilst needing TV & handheld-If you don't already have a console that can play the games you want to play (E.G, if you want to play animal crossing and don't already have it on a different platform)I would recommend, especially if you can get it on sale!",Alfie Hudson,Very good all-in-one console,30 September 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought for 5yr old daughter, she‚Äôs now 6 and plays this all the time, loves all the Mario games particularly Mario Odessey with its open world and assisted play for younger players, and animal crossing is also a firm favourite.The we have a screen protector, and no case yet however it has survived a few knocks and drops so quite resilient.The controllers however considering their cost, don‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôd last. One of our controllers started to ‚Äòdrift‚Äô to the left, causing character and menus to keep going left. Rather than buy a new controller set for ¬£70 odd, I purchased a new analogue stick for ¬£2-¬£3 on eBay and opened up the controller and fitted it myself, I‚Äôm no techie, just a mum with a screwdriver was easy to do! Works good as new, so worth a try if you have this problem!",Morgie,Great fun.. controllers don‚Äôt stand the test of time,21 September 2021,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have the NES, SNES, N64 & Gamecube, and a family member has the Wii, I'm a fan of all console's rather than one in particular.I was hesitant to get this after the casual Wii and the failed Wii U, but Breath of the wild was something I wanted to play. I have noticed a few glaring issues with this console.Firstly; it is in some ways poorly designed, an identity crisis with sub par quality in some area's. They made a handheld console you fit into an awkward dock to play on a TV, but can't be played if it isn't charged, and doesn't come with the ¬£50 official controller, meaning you must resort to the small Joy Con's which are greatly inferior (and somewhat small) compared to the other big two. You have to make sure the switch's settings for TV output are auto otherwise it'll strongly to show anything on the correct HDMI setting. This makes TV player's feel like an after thought.You then have their other console the lite, a slightly more underwhelming version which is solely a handheld. It would've been wiser for them to make this switch the handheld only and then a slightly beefed up TV console. Overall, not good design by Nintendo, but this is following the unsuccessful Wii U.Another big negative; the game library. Nintendo used to have a very competitive game library with 1st and 3rd party game's (like on the N64, Goldeneye/Perfect Dark, Conkers Bad Fur Day, Turok etc) after the Game Cube they completely tried to stop competing with the other big two and dropped the more adult game's for more child/family friendly game's (which make the vast bulk of their library and opted for the casual demographic instead of the hardcore.) This is a bit of a kick in the teeth as it means the Switch mainly comprises of it's expected 1st party title's (Zelda, several Mario's etc) and then a swathe of ports unless you want a game targeted for a very niche audience or children. Pretty bad, the N64 was a little difficult to program for and had the restriction of cartridges yet it's game library had powerhouse titles. Maybe the move back to cartridges restricts what can be done on the switch?Another big issue I don't think has ever been brought up, Nintendo (with this console especially) has the market absolutely flooded with cheap and nasty 3rd party products, unofficial products likely from China, that in some cases even try to mimic official Nintendo products (like the Pro Controller). Then there's officially licensed products by Nintendo from other party's, like the PowerA controller etc, whose quality is on the cheap/flimsy side of the spectrum. In all this dumbs down and gives a bit of a wild west free for all experience when trying to get a half decent and quality product, something much easier to avoid on the other big two console's. This is reminiscent of what nearly killed the game industry in the early 80s with no real standard's which ironically Nintendo back then partly saved.There are pro's to this console, it is portable if that's your desire, and there are some very good game's. For children it'll be especially good as the library caters to the casual gamer and children. But the above issues are things to be considered, and hopefully Nintendo will in the future make better design choices to negate all of this. They also need to get more big titles exclusive to the console (new IPs, not ports or the standard one's).It's a tricky console, for the few games that are good, I love it, but in the larger picture, the console is very grating. Also how can they have what is effectively a tablet, and make no use of any streaming platforms? (Netflix and Amazon Prime video at the p least) a real wasted opportunity.",Dagoth Ur,The harsh truth about this console,19 September 2021,3.0 out of 5 stars

Ive had the console for a while now and I've had no problems at all with it, everything is in great condition and i am enjoying my time with it.

"It could not connect to the internet. We called Amazon, they tried to troubleshoot. Amazon transferred the call to Nintendo and they confirmed that the Nintendo was faulty. They then suggested we send it for repair. No thanks I said, I don't want a repaired device when I paid for a brand new one. Amazon agreed to take it back and give a refund. A driver will come to collect it. It was a disappointment and now we have to wait a week for collection and refund. This was my child's birthday present and clearly a disappointment. Nevertheless, Amazon's customer service is second to none. They are fast, efficient and always go by what the customer asks.",Georgina,Does not work,28 August 2021,1.0 out of 5 stars

    ¬†Within a month of having this switch, it began to malfunction. Firstly, it occasionally completely turns off mid-game and will not turn back on even when you plug in the charger. I had to search YouTube videos to find an answer as to why it was happening to no avail. I have to wait at least 20 minutes everytime this happens for the console to turn back on. When I first opened it from the box I noticed the left joy con didn‚Äôt feel as secure as the right. Over time this has become progressively worse to the point that the left joy con will slide off during game play.

"I'm a 90s kid. I grew up in the age of platformers. I originally bought a PS4 and I had a good time with it, but the happiest I felt playing it was the Spyro Reignited trilogy. That's what I am at heart, I'm a cutesy platformer fan.(I also adored Tomb Raider and did spend a lot of time on Modern Warfare).Anyway... This seems to be the console for me. I love that it's handheld because I like to play lying down in bed or wherever around the house. But more importantly the games are exactly the type to appeal to a 90s kid.Platformers and Pokemon... Simple games. Not epic dark souls stuff. That's what I enjoy. I've been enjoying Mario Kart 8 and Oddysey so far.",Rusty Shackleford,I am very happy with this,June 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars
"do not buy from the eshop.as much as possible i advise following the rule: seek out physical copies (second-hand is even better so as not to support the appalling business practices of nintendo).even if the software you download is categorically unplayable they will not offer you a refund, no matter what.this isn't even the industry standard; with microsoft, steam, and sony all offering much more realistic refund policies on digital content.the switch is a great device but held back by nintendo's archaic, draconian policies. don't support them in this by buying second-hand whenever possible (from sellers who, guess what, often accept returns and refunds if the item is faulty).don't charge me for a wet pile of broken glass when what you promised was a glass of water. i will not stand for this and i hope that nobody else will, either.",Alex A,do not buy from the eshop,June 2021,1.0 out of 5 stars

It definitely worth the money I bought it for. I bought on Black Friday last year so I have had the Nintendo switch for about 5 months and it has great quality on the screen very clear and easy to use and also you will have to step up an account first as well but it is easy to do. When you connect to the tv you do you get an HMI lead with and it comes with its plug and it's a docking station for the tv so it easy to step up and the quality on the tv is amazing it is really good quality for me. It come with everything include in the Nintendo switch box. Definitely would buy another one but on black Friday deals.

    ¬†This was a birthday present to the 5 year old, that came at the right time for us, as we are spending lockdown in a rather small flat, with three kids.Before I describe the specs of the Switch, I'd like to explain why this was selected instead of the Switch Light or the more expensive PS or Xbox.Our older kids are 5 and 6, which is almost the age when they can ""do it themselves"", but not quite there yet. The operation functions of Nintendo Switch are easily learnt, the kids can set it up themselves and the variety of games Nintendo offers is often in the right mind for children this age - i.e. not so sophisticated or complicated that they would need an adult's help. The Switch Light is a good option of course, especially for a kid with no siblings, but without the ability to hook the console to the tv, it's going to be harder to turn this into a multi participation venue, i.e. only one kids at a time.With the Nintendo Switch, we often see the kids opt for TV game mode, and we can all participate in active games such as ""Just Dance"" or ""Tokyo 2020 Olympics"", which the game rewards them through actual movement.Why not PS or Xbox? Well, they're more expensive and as described above sophisticated. So, if you have a very technical child of 10+ maybe they are the better option. For us, the fact that they can hook up the controller themselves and the games are plain and simple was the selling point.What's in the box?===============The Switch condole, a tv hookup hub, a charging cable, 2 Joy Cons (note - 2 Joy Cons makes one whole controller in essence, and some games would require them as such, i.e. you need both per user), and one Joy Con Grip (to combine them to one controller).Game modes:============- The solo mode, as seen on the second picture/the video, provides the kids hours of fun on their own.- The TV hookup (photo 3)1) You can play solo with a big screen. Easy to setup - you just need an empty socket near the tv and an HDMI connection. You then can use the two Joy-Con's with the the controller hub that comes with the switch.2) Another option (for games which allow it) is to use each Joy-Con as a solo controller. The Joy-Cons are gyroscopic and feel the hand movement, so you can play ""Just Dance"" or ""Mario Kart"" by moving your hands around. they even provide feedback in terms of vibrations, and remind of the old Wii consoles.- Detaching the JoyCons and using the console as a small screen, this is the worst option but it works too, there's a small leg that allows the console to stand upright (but it tends to fall off, a bit of a design flaw that is negligible since this game mode is not the best anyways).To sum up all the Pro's: hours of fun, interactive games which will keep the kids fit not just in 'zombie' mode, dual game mode as mentioned and adequate for kids up from the age of 5 to setup on their own.To add to that: there are dozens of game around, with genres that fit just about anyone.Con's:=====Not all is perfect with the Nintendo Switch and here are some faults and the way to overcome them (if applicable):- The games are expensive. A new game is around ¬£40, which is not optimal when you want the kids to have a variety. Also, if you bought a game that they didn't like/can't handle - that's money down the toilet.Luckily, the Nintendo Shop has previous and free periods that allow you to test games (but we don't really bother with these).- The Switch comes with two Joy Cons. If you want to play more than two people you will have to get another set, and another grip. while this is relatively cheap, you will then want a charging dock, so you won't have to rotate between them, and it doesn't really end...- You would probably want a screen protector, a travel case, and a few more games... so again when it comes to costs, add at least ¬£100-150 to the original price (and prob more).- The worst thing is the need to subscribe to the Nintendo Shop to be able to play online multi games in several games. this is downright infuriating, as you need to pay for something you already paid for. However, we found that we enjoy the games without the online option as it is.Good games to start with:=====================- Animal Crossings New Horizons - especially for calmer kids who likes building and strategy.- Mario Kart - this is brilliant, the superlatives this game has received are very just, it provides several game modes and hours of fun for all of the family (I enjoy playing with the kids myself, and we get quite competitive)- Just Dance - a good workout in form of dancing with the Joy Cons which will provide hours of fun, but each participant needs a JoyCon.Hope this helped someone to decide whether to get one or not. and If not - feel free to ask questions or comment, or vote this 'helpful' if indeed it was. Thanks and Game on!",Jon Dee,"Fantastic, would have been hard to survive lockdown without this",February 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars

Ordered the switch as a Christmas present for my little girl. She opened on Christmas Day very excited but the docking station was faulty. We bought a new hdmi cable thinking it was that and tried to connect it to different tv‚Äôs but it still wouldn‚Äôt work. As the switch work when hand held I let her play on it and download her games with was downloads. When I contacted to ask if the docking station could be replaced I was told o could return the whole gaming system for a full refund which I didn‚Äôt want to do as my daughter had already downloaded her games so she would be losing games if we returned the whole system. The did offer ¬£10 money back which wouldn‚Äôt replace a docking station. After a while this increased to ¬£25 however a docking station is ¬£80 to buy.,Kirstie,Faulty docking station,December 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought a Switch for my son for Christmas. I'm a gamer myself but never had a Switch or used one to any great extent.I had heard all the hype and my son's friends have them hence why I bought one.What surprised me was the numerous negative aspects of the console and it's usablilty.Physically the console is ok but a bit fiddly in my opinion. Removeable joycons is a nice idea but the sticks aren't the best (sometimes pushing up also goes left for example) and when attached to the switch there is a bit of give. Taking them off is fiddly and half the time the shoulder button gets pressed in the process, affecting the game you are playing.The kickstand at the back to hold it up on a table is useless. The console falls over most of the time and my son's came off the first time he tried to stand it up. Reattached ok but terrible quality.I was also surprised how small the screen is. My mobile phone is almost as large.The user interface on the console is ok but could be slicker. A lot of options take two taps to confirm, why?Then we get to the eShop - what a terrible setup. I managed to purchase a game for my son after entering a password THREE times (again, why?) and because I was buying for my son I could not save the card details. So buying another game meant entering all the card details again (oh and entering the password three times again of course).It may have been because it's Christmas Day, but half the time I accessed the eShop it threw a connection error. Trying again it would work but every so often I got the error again. It then refused to download the games I purchased and we awoke the next morning to find they had magically appeared (and it wasn't that it took a while to download, they just weren't on the home screen when first purchased).Finally by the end of the day, the eShop just gave up accepting my card details. I tried two other cards and both of them did not work either. So currently I can't buy any games for my son.Moving on to parental controls. These are iffy on most console in my opinion - the PS4 ones are pretty awful but after a while you can get them set up and then it's ok. Nintendo Switch parental controls are in a whole other league of terrible however, and the restrictions mean I have to purchase games on the console and cannot use the web eShop (which I am trying to do because of my card issue above).I have entered my password to do things so many times on the console that I can type it without looking at the screen now.The games library on the Switch is nothing special to me. There are of course the Mario exclusives which my son likes but other than that, most games are accessible on other (better) consoles, or are just glorified versions of mobile apps. The eShop prices are shocking for most games, so I've opted for physical copies of some games which means a tiny SD card that a child is quite likely to lose.Also on the game sharing side of things - I have another son and another Switch (for my sins). I understand game sharing can't be a free for all because people will take advantage, but even with a Nintendo Online Family Account the game sharing is non-existant. The popular workaround is a nightmare especially when the kids don't understand why Child A needs to use Child B's console. Again, I'm a gamer, I'm used to account setups for these kinds of things but Nintendo take the awkwardness to a whole other level.Plenty of other points to mention about the console, some good and some bad, but the above gripes have led me to write this review (rant). It's an ok console with some ok games, the portable nature is good, but the Nintendo accounts system, eShop and parental controls are terrible. Either that or I've had a few too many glasses of wines over Christmas this year, and the whole thing is actually a doddle.",Neil,Over-Hyped with Many Faults,December 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars

This is the first console I've had  since the 90s and it is awesome I'm 42 haven't gamed in years and bought this along with zelda breath of the wild and precious couldn't be happier. The console was easy to install and set up is very good quality and the fact you can use as a hand held device is awesome. I'm disabled and in an electric wheelchair I struggle to find things to do as I'm house bound and my disabilitys affect me greatly so this has been a absolutely wonderful experience I am totally hooked and timebflys it's a nice distraction from my chronic pain and has given me something other than reading or needle work in converted and I didn't think it was possible for me to be a gamer but I am now lol ! At first I was dying all the time couldn't get a grip with controls but after a few months I'm progressing well don't die anymore. I also purchased as pro controller from nintendo and that's awesome too and totally worth the money as I tried the cheap pro controller s and just wasted more money than just buying the Nintendo pro controller in the first place and Amazon have it 6 pounds cheaper than elsewhere I found my game play improved with the pro controller. This is a fantastic console even my friend that has a PlayStation got one as he loved the game play the simple way you can just take it out the cradle and you have hand held game to take away with you. I find it such a versatile console that suits my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and easy to set the nintendo switch account to I'm not the most tech savvy person but I managed all of this myself very intuitive controls also can not say the fact you use the cons as individual controlles for two player games and use the screen as your TV is great .,‚ôøÔ∏èReview,Absolutely awesome best purchase in years !!,December 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars

My son has a DS but had saved his pocket money as he really wanted a switch as well so I helped him buy it. Its a great game machine (I am not a gamer) for my son and has kept him occupied over lockdown. The only thing I will say which is negative is the cost of the actual games they are very expensive and you are looking at around ¬£50 for some of the newer games and more when you have new platforms added to the games you have.

"It was probably quite revolutionary 3 years ago, but as processing power increases in the newer generation of consoles, getting a switch might be a hard sell. Other consoles have more third party support, more games, and you will get the best experience (higher frame rates) on either a PC or a next gen console. That coupled with the issues relating to joycon drift (a problem occurring due to flimsy joysticks) means you'll have to treat them like delicate porcelain.Only get this if:1) You have a strong cult following of Nintendo games (such as I), and are willing to wait patiently (by patiently I mean a good solid 2-3 years) for Nintendo to release their strongest first party titles. This is what it boils down to. Games sell consoles, and Nintendo needs more first party games to compete. And I don't mean constant remasters.2) You're just here to play Nintendo exclusives. Choose a switch for Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, Metroid etc. You will almost always get the worst experience in any other game that's accessible on multiple platforms. Triple A titles from other devs will also give the shaft to the switch in most circumstances, as they demand higher processing power in future titles. Because let's be honest, would you run a game off of a micro SD card or an SSD?3) The convenience of 'switching' between the TV screen and the handheld mode with incredible ease. This is one of the main features that I love, and it distinguishes itself from the competition with its incredible ease of use. No other mainline console does this with such finesse and simplicity, that I have to tip my hat off to Nintendo for this one. It definitely blurs the line between mobile, handheld, and home console gaming.",K,Not for everyone,13 October 2020,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Avoid the Nintendo switch like the plague, even the updated version has the same joy-con drift and Nintendo refuse to take responsibility and fix the issue.

"Not going to lie the delivery process said it was going to take a while and it came it 2 days!!! I was a bit shocked at the price but I was desperate for one so I was willing to pay the price. When it came I was baffled because the box was small so I didn‚Äôt think it was the switch, when I inboxed it I immediately knew I had payed for a second hand switch, the joycons had scratches on the back and were dirty. The dock was dusty and dirty and had obvious signs of wear and tear. All in all it works but I had some trouble with it connecting to the internet as it would connect and disconnect randomly!  I‚Äôm just a bit annoyed that it was second hand and for nearly ¬£350!! They‚Äôre cheaper brand new, but everywhere is out of stock :( I‚Äôm disappointed by what I got compared to the reviews as all the ones I saw came like they would brand new and it says nowhere in the description that second hand options are available only new ones so I would like to honestly know why I received a second hand one ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",Jade,Second hand switch for nearly ¬£350 ?!?!,July 2020,3.0 out of 5 stars

"DO NOT buy a nintendo switch unless you want to spend hundreds, and I literally mean HUNDREDS, on the maintenance of it and replacement parts!In 2 years we've had to replace the charger 5 times and the joy cons 3 times because it all just stops working every couple of months. Prices for replacement joycons START at ¬£65!!! Replacement chargers are ¬£25!! You can buy cheaper none branded bits but they stop working even quicker.The blasted thing has been a never ending money drain! After a little bit of research we found out that the thing is DESIGNED to break, hence why the parts are so expensive.

"I have had many of the previous handheld consoles, but the games always left me feeling I have been short changed compared to their home console version (even the PS Vita which, despite having so much potential, ended up having  the Nintendo 3DS version of ports). The reviews of Witcher 3 sold the Nintendo Switch to me and I enjoy it on the Switch as much as my first play through on the X Box One S.In the 5 months I have had the Switch, I have only played it docked once (on my first day just to check it worked). I choose the Switch over Switch Lite for the following reasons:1. There is a lot of internet comment about the joy stick drifting, so I thought having detachable joy cons will make it easier to replace any faulty joystick. (No drifting in over 5 months of ownership)2. Bigger screen3. Longer battery life4. Even though I knew I was going to be playing in handheld, I wanted the option of the other modes for future proofing.The only downside of the Switch is that the games are more expensive compared to the home consoles.",Kenny,Finally handheld gaming that doesn't leave you feeling short changed,25 May 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars

"It bewilders me every generation how Nintendo manages to sucker so many people. The Wii had its charm but was overly gimmicky and sold a ton, the Wii-U deservedly flopped as it was awful, however the Switch is the most bewildering Nintendo console to date in terms of how it has succeeded.Everything about this console is inferior to its contemporaries. It cannot sustain decent graphics, it lacks storage space and it lacks a varied and affordable library of games. Yet the console is constantly out of stock.The console is fragile and easily scratched. The Joy-Cons are notoriously fragile and also ridiculously expensive.Many of the games are seriously expensive - ¬£50 for the latest rip-off Pok√©mon? It looks to have improved very little visually over the 3DS excursions and still relies on a tired formula and the con of selling two identical games. Pretty much all games that are found on other consoles are also cheaper for other consoles.So what advantage does the Switch have? It is indeed portable. Not exactly lightweight like the 3DS. I'd want a sturdy case and screen covers before taking this anywhere, and that will be expensive. Family games? That's true. Mario? He's here yet again. Multiplayer? It's a big positive too.Having said all that, you can easily spend about ¬£400 in order to get the Switch, buy protective covers and just one or two games. It is a hell of an investment and not worth it, in my opinion. I think Nintendo have lured people again with something gimmicky. Put your money on a PS4 Pro or a PC. You'll get a much better experience of good games.",SplitMind,Very over-rated and over-priced,22 May 2020,2.0 out of 5 stars

"Well this has been an absolute lifesaver during the pandemic. I haven't left my house in 7 weeks and I was lucky enough to get hold a switch in early April, after trying to get one all through March for my birthday. I'm so glad I did as during this time, being able to play Animal Crossing has been something to look forward to during these uncertain times. Pandemic aside, the console itself is really good. I've hooked it up to the TV a couple of times but I mainly play it handheld. I mainly play Playstation 4 and haven't had a handheld console since the Nintendo 3DS, but so far it's been great. The battery life is decent, definitely better than what I have had before and it charges pretty quickly either docked or with the charger. It's comfortable to hold despite the size of it but I'd recommend taking breaks if you're playing for long periods as it can be straining on your hands. But other than that it's a great console and there a great range of games for it.",Jordan,Great Console,18 May 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars

When unboxing this it comes with a bit of charge so you can try it out, but I highly recommend giving it a good charge before have a play on it. When turning on for the first time you will need to make sure you have an Nintendo account so you will have to set an account up and if more than one person using this have different profiles for each person.

"I purchased this console for my 6 year old daughter and although she thinks it's fantastic,  I think this console has the worse user friendly interface I've come across. . You need to constantly sign in!! Sign in to play games online and link accounts ect etc. I set up one game under my daughter's account which is under the main parents account and now it's asking for another online paid pass to play!!! so each member of the family needs an online pass. How is this user friendly at all. I wouldn't be that bothered but this particular game needs to be online to play!!I've noticed most games have missing dialogue any intro scenes have subtitles which you need to read which is a cost-cutting. This is obviously easier for game developers for different regions but not user friendly or enjoyable to a 6 year old. Games are expensive and so are the accessories. PS4 is by far a better machine just a shame that the games on the PS4 are not geared for my daughter's age range.",Daniel kelly,Constantly asked to sign in and online pass needed for some games,2 May 2020,1.0 out of 5 stars

So for extra money I‚Äôd go for this. I was on the fence about this product but if you love Zelda games you have to get this for BOTW alone.,Chris,Nintendo do it again.

"A great console for those who love Nintendo.Nintendo consoles have long been recognised as the most fun consoles on the market. I have found that for 'serious gaming' i head to the PS4 or Xbox but for sheer fun i always pick up the Nintendo. Bought this for my 6 year old as her first console and she isnt disappointed. The variety of games is excellent and all ages are catered for. generic joycons, controllers and accessories are available in abundance and are almost every bit as good as the nintendo items so dont fear generic items.All of your usual favourites (mario, zelda, lego charatcters) are available in a variety of titles as are leagues of puzzle sport and interactive games. Any age, any ability you have what you need for hours of fun. recommend a decent sized memory card, online games are frequently on sale and money can be saved by buying the online version instead of the physical game.",Adam Steele,Excellent,April 2020,5.0 out of 5 stars

"I am so angry of the company that makes Switch! This is for young children! My 7 year old child now has access to an online portal and can download whatever he wants without my permission! He used to said in a funny way he wanted to die and put his hands around his neck like if they were ropes and stood on a chair ready to jump! This was because he had seen these stuff on youtube. He also made us buy more and more stuff he had seen on youtube and did lots of crazy, silly ""tricks"", I was fed up. Finally I managed to delete the bloody youtube from everywhere which was really hard as my TV, phone everything comes wih youtube and it is really hard to get rid of. And then today my son showed me the youtube is on his Switch!! I am so angry! Please contact me and delete my membership ASAP and send me instructions how to get rid of, otherwise I am gonna send both of our switches back with a serious complaint!!",Marianne,Outrageos!!

"Bought this Nintendo switch for my 4 year old sons Christmas & what can i say it‚Äôs really great, everything so much smaller & lightweight instead of big heavy built consoles! Easy for my son to play too. Only 1 thing i would say is buy screen protector‚Äôs for the switch so when docking & un-docking you don‚Äôt scratch your screen! Apart from that i think this is a great wee computer, switching from playing on ur TV or on a table top & the handheld mode! Love it!",Amazon Customer,Best computer i have purchased,30 December 2021,5.0 out of 5 stars
